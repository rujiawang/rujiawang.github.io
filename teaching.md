#### CS 350 Computer Organization & Assembly Language Programming (Fall 2018)

Lecture: M/W 3:15PM--4:30PM
Lab: F 3:15PM--4:05PM

#### Introduction
This course covers several fundamental topics that solve the question: How does the computer system work? You will start with concepts like number representations, digital logics, bit operations. Then, you will start to explore how the control flow and datapath are designed inside of the system. Finally, you will learn how to write assembly language to operate the hardware unit.

#### Office Hour
M/W 4:30-5:30PM or by appointment (SB 208F).
