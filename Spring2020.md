We will be using Piazza/Blackboard to post detailed schedule/course notes.

#### CS 350 Computer Organization and Assembly Languages (Spring 2020)

Lecture: T/TR 3:15PM - 4:30PM 

Lab: W 3:15PM--4:05PM

#### Introduction
This course covers several fundamental topics that solve the question: How does the computer system work? You will start with concepts like number representations, digital logics, bit operations. Then, you will start to explore how the control flow and datapath are designed inside of the system. Finally, you will learn how to write assembly language to operate the hardware unit.

The office hour for the TAs are posted on Piazza.
