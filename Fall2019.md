#### CS 470 Computer Architecture(Fall 2019)

Lecture: M/W 11:25AM - 12:40PM 


##### Introduction
This is a new computer architecture course offered in the CS department. We will continue to explore the classical as well as the state-of-the-art computer architecture designs that help to build high performance, low power, high scalability, and high-reliability systems.
As we are living in the post-Moore-law era, the technology scaling difficulties, as well as the emerging applications, bring us many challenges in designing low power and high-performance general purpose computing platforms. This course will cover several design challenges and introduce the trend in current computer architecture and system design.


##### Objectives
You will study the challenges and designs in computer architecture in order to understand the basics, principles and precedents. Based on such understanding, you will:

* learn how a modern computer works underneath, 
* evaluate tradeoffs of different designs and ideas, 
* implement a principled design (a simple microprocessor and pipeline), 
* learn to systematically debug increasingly complex systems, 
* develop novel, out-of-the-box designs.

##### Course Organization
Lectures on classical topics:

1.	Cache and memory hierarchy
2.	Pipeline, out of order execution and speculative execution
3.	SIMD and GPU
4.	Multi-core, multi-processor, coherance
5.	Network and interconnection

Lectures on the state-of-the-art topics:

1.	New memory technologies (NVMs, 3d stack memory, etc)
2.	Memory centric computing
3.	Accelerators for machine learning (GPU, TPU ...)
4.	System security (side channel attacks, SGX, ...)
